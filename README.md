## Placement Portal Application

A role-based web application that replaces manual procedures with a centralized digital system to optimize campus recruitment. While avoiding duplicate registrations and keeping organized placement records, the platform allows administrators to oversee companies and placement drives, companies to post jobs and evaluate applications, and students to apply and monitor their status.

Built using **Flask**, **Jinja2**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **SQLite**.
